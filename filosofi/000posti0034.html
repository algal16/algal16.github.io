Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the process of reasoning, for they would understand at first sight, and are not used to seek for principles. And others, on the contrary, who are accustomed to reason from principles, do not at all understand matters of feeling, seeking principles, and being unable to see at a glance.
<p>
Those who judge of a work by rule are in regard to others as those who have a watch are in regard to others. One says, " It is two hours ago ;" the other says, " It is only three-quarters of an hour." I look at my watch, and say to the one, " You are weary," and to the other, " Time gallops with you;" for it is only an hour and a half ago, and I laugh at those who tell me that time goes slowly with me, and that I judge by imagination. They do not know that I judge by my watch.
<p>
The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. Ordinary person find no difference between men.
<p>
People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others.
<p>
Nature has made all her truths independent of one another. Our art makes one dependent on the other. But this is not natural. Each keeps its own place.
<p>
Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and meanings differently arranged have different effects.
<p>
Do you wish people to believe good of you? Don't speak.
